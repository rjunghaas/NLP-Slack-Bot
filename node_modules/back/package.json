The timeout is what is based on an [exponential\nbackoff](http://dthain.blogspot.nl/2009/02/exponential-backoff-in-distributed.html) of course!\nIt will repeatedly all this callback based on the backoff options you passed to\nthe back instance until it exhausts its efforts. When it has exhausted its\nattempts, it will return an error as the first argument to the callback.\n\n#### `back.close()`\n\nClear backoff timer in cases where you want to dispose of the instance before the `callback` is executed.\n\n[Primus]: https://github.com/3rd-Eden/primus\n\n",
